Compare functions between DataFrame API and SparkSQL (As of Spark 2.4.0)

Functions in DataFrame API, but not in SparkSQL:
---
 + udf, pandas_udf
 + broadcast, lit, expr, col, column


Functions in DataFrame API, can be handled in SparkSQL
 + asc_nulls_first, asc_nulls_last, desc_nulls_first, desc_nulls_last
   Spark SQL does not support `Order BY col ASC null first` etc
   adding a reference column IF(col is null,1,0) in order By clause of Spark SQL
   Spark SQL default: null is the smallest in ordering

    spark.sql("""

        SELECT c1 FROM VALUES (1), (NULL), (12), (3) AS (c1)
        ORDER BY IF(isnull(c1),1,0), c1 ASC

    """).show()

Functions only in Spark SQL, not in DataFrame API
---
 + higher-order functions: transform, exists, filter, aggregate, zip_with
 + XML related: xpath, xpath_boolean, xpath_double, xpath_float, xpath_int
              , xpath_long, xpath_number, xpath_short, xpath_string
 + parse_url: similar to XML pather, this can retrieve HOST, QUERY etc from a valid URL
 + inline, inline_outer: similar to explode, explode_outer (array of structs)
   (explode + dereference) should be used with select/selectExpr
   withColumn will not working when multiple fields exist in structs
 + named_struct: like struct, map, array, very useful
 + str_to_map: like split, but create a MapType() from string
 + percentile: can be used to calculate exact median
 + stack: can be used to demornalize a df
 + find_in_set: 
 + sentences: split paragraph into array of arrays (sentences of words)
 + elt: similar to choose() in Pentaho
 + java_method, reflect: only applied to static method from Java/Scala
   ref: https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/spark-sql-Expression-CallMethodViaReflection.html
 + other less used:
   + nvl, nvl2, nullif, not, isnotnull
   + cube, cot, e, pi, ln, std, power, sign, mod, pmod, negative, positive, count_min_sketch
   + space, chr, binary, char, bit_length, char_length, character_length, octet_length
   + current_database, input_file_block_length, input_file_block_start
   + cardinality, assert_true, uuid


Functions only in SparkSQL which can be simulated with DF API:
---
 + if,ifnull ->  df:{when,otherwise}
 + left, right -> df:substring  left(A,2) -> substring('A',1,2)  right(A,2) -> substring('A',-2,2)
 + position -> df:{instr,locate}
 + printf -> df:format_string
 + replace -> df:regexp_replace, df.replace
 + rollup -> df.rollup
 + like -> df.rlike


Duplicated functions only in SparkSQL to compatible with Standard SQL:
---
 + to_unix_timestamp -> {df,sql}:unix_timestamp 
 + now -> {df,sql}:current_timestamp
 + weekday -> {df,sql}:dayofweek
 + day -> {df,sql}:dayofmonth


Exist in both but using different names:
---
 + df:create_map -> sql:map
 + df:bitwiseNOT -> sql:~
 + df:countDistince -> sql:count(distinct ..)
 + df:sumDistinct  -> sql:sum(distinct ..)
 + df.approxQuantile(col, probabilities, relativeError) -> sql:{approx_percentile,percentile_approx}
 + df:astype -> sql:{cast,int,bigint,boolean,decimal,double,date,float,string,timestamp,tinyint,smallint}


Exist in both but work differently
---
 + regexp_replace(), regexp_extract():
   DF version support PCRE regex, can use \1, \2 in pattern and $1, $2 in replacement
   Spark SQL version does not support PCRE
 + `column` as function arguments: 
   many of the DF-API functions only support scalar argument, i.e. date_add(d, N)
   the 2nd argument must be an integer, in Spark SQL, this can be a column. This makes
   SparkSQL more powerful.
 + sequence() in DF-API support only integers, while date, timestamp and byte 
   are supported with Spark SQL (extra power)


Some notes:
---
  (1) whenever using column as function arguments is disabled which trigger an Error:
      `#'Column' object is not callable`, try using its SparkSQL corresponding builtin 
      functions. for example, using a column name for array index will work in Spark SQL
      , but not for API functions

  (2) in DF-API, logic '|', '&', but in SQL, need 'or', 'and'
