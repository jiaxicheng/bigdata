## Apache Hive on Spark with Spark Standalone cluster (HDFS as storage) ##

Apache Hive must have the following directives in hive-site.xml, or add these into spark-default.conf
under the same folder as hive-site.xml under $HIVE_CONF_DIR (i.e. $HIVE_HOME/conf)
```
  <property>
    <name>spark.master</name>
    <value>spark://lexington:7077</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>spark.submit.deployMode</name>
    <value>client</value>
  </property>
```

*Note:* the following is setting the cluster mode(port 6066 instead of 7077), this will need to have 
apache-hive installed on all worker nodes which is not flexible.
```
  <property>
    <name>spark.master</name>
    <value>spark://lexington:6066</value>
  </property>
```

=== Softwares required: ===
* Spark Cluster nodes (both Manager and Workers):
  - spark-latest -> /data/hdfs/spark-2.2.1.no_hive (Worker)

* Hive2 Server:
  - spark-latest -> /data/hdfs/spark-2.2.1.no_hive
  - hive-latest -> /data/hdfs/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin
  - hadoop-latest -> /data/hdfs/hadoop-2.9.0

* Hive Metastore node:
  - hive-latest -> /data/hdfs/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin
  - hadoop-latest -> /data/hdfs/hadoop-2.9.0

Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException Failed to
get a spark session: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Failed
to create spark client. (state=42000,code=40000)
```
Solution: Likely the compatibility issue between spark versions. When compiling spark, do NOT use `-Phive`

```
ERROR: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /data/hdfs/apache-hive-2.3.3-bin/lib/hive-exec-2.3.3.jar
```
Solution: set `spark.submit.deployMode = client`
Thus all drivers had been compiled on the client-end before submitting to the spark cluster. no need 
to find the resources (i.e. jar files) on the individual worker in the cluster-mode
